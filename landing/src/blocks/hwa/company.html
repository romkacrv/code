          <li>Always think about performance. No premature optimizations, but we never do things that can significantly
            slow down the work of an application.

        <ul>
          <li> Documentation. We discuss and document our decisions, so that each step we make is deliberate and
            transparent.

        <ul>
          <li>Flexibility. We make progress by short iterations. On the one hand, it allows to have constant customer's
            feedback about a product. On the other hand, this approach provides that changes in requirements (which always
            happen) will be handled in a timely way.
